- Planning and forecasting

##    Objectives of inventory management

- Ensuring Adequate supply
- Reducing costs
- Improving efficiency
- Maximizing profitability
- Providing data for decision-making

#  Functions of Inventory


##  The primary functions of inventory


- Supporting production
- Meeting customer demand
- Reducing lead timers
- Providing a safety net
- Facilitating economies of scale

##  Importance of balancing inventory functions
> Inventory balancing is the process of moving excess inventory from one retail location to a retail location where that inventory is in demand.

# Costs of Inventory

##  Types of inventory costs
- Holding costs
- Ordering costs
- Shortage costs
- Obsolescence costs
- Quality costs

##  Factors that affect inventory costs
- Demand variability
- Lead time variability
- Order Quality
- Seasonality
- Supply chain distruptions
- Product perishablility


# Classification of Inventory

##    Types of inventory
- Raw Materials
- Work-in-Progress (WIP)
- Finished Goods
- Maintenance, Repair, and Operating (MRO) Supplies
- Consignment Inventory
- Safety Stocks
- Obsolete Inventory
- Perishable Inventory
- Seasonal Inventory

# Deterministic and Probabilistic Inventory Models

##    What is a deterministic inventory model?
> A deterministic inventory model is a type of inventory management system that **assumes that demand for a product is known and constant**.

Examples:

a. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

b. Reorder Point (ROP)

##    What is a probabilistic inventory model?
> Probabilistic inventory models are mathematical models used in inventory management that **take into account uncertain demand and other random variables** that can affect inventory levels. 

Examples:

a. Periodic Review Model
b. Continuous Review Model

##   Pros and Cons

`Deterministic Inventory Models`

| `Advantages` | `Disadvantages` | 
| :-- | :-- |
| Simple and easy to understand. | Assumes a constant demand, which may not reflect actual demand variability. |
| Suitable for situations where demand and lead times are known and constant. | Doesn't account for uncertainty and risk. |
| Provides a precise calculation of inventory levels. | May lead to stockouts or overstocking if demand or lead times vary.  |


##  Pros and Cons
 
`Probabilistic Inventory Models`

| `Advantages` | `Disadvantages` |
| :-- | :-- | 
| Can account for demand and lead time variability. |   More complex than deterministic models. | 
| Provides more realistic estimates of inventory levels.|     Requires accurate data and statistical analysis. | 
| Can incorporate uncertainty and risk into decision-making. |      May involve assumptions that may not hold true in practice. |


# Quantity Discounts

##    What is a quantity discount?
> Quantity discount is a pricing strategy used by businesses to encourage customers to purchase more of a product by offering discounts for larger quantities.

##    How quantity discounts affect inventory costs
-    Ordering a larger quantity of a product to get a quantity discount can be a smart move for a business.
-    However, storing excess inventory can lead to additional costs such as rent, utilities, and insurance for a warehouse or storage facility.
-    Holding excess inventory can tie up capital that could be used for other purposes, increasing the opportunity cost of inventory.
-    Excess inventory can become obsolete or spoil over time, leading to additional costs associated with disposal or write-offs.
-    These costs can offset the savings gained from the quantity discount, so it's important to carefully consider the trade-offs before ordering in bulk.

# Perpetual and Periodic Inventory Control Systems

##    What is a perpetual inventory control system?
> A perpetual inventory control system is a method of inventory management that maintains a continuous record of inventory levels and transactions in real-time.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}

- It uses technology such as barcode scanners and inventory management software to track the movement of goods.
- Inventory levels are updated automatically with each transaction, allowing businesses to have a real-time view of their inventory levels.
- Benefits include increased accuracy, reduced inventory holding costs, improved efficiency in managing inventory, and better visibility into stock levels.
- Implementing and maintaining the system can be costly and requires ongoing training and support for employees.

##    What is a periodic inventory control system?
> A periodic inventory control system involves physical inventory counts at regular intervals, such as monthly or annually.

-    The system relies on manual counts and does not provide real-time updates of inventory levels.
-    Inventory levels are updated periodically to reflect the purchases, sales, and other inventory movements that occurred during the period.
-    This system can be less accurate than a perpetual inventory control system, as it is more susceptible to errors and discrepancies.
-    The periodic inventory control system is often used by small businesses or those with a low volume of inventory, as it requires less investment in technology and resources.
