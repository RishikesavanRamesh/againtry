As a system administrator, you may need to keep track of all commands typed on your Linux system, even if multiple terminal windows are used or commands are typed with a leading space or tab. In this blog post, you will be shown how to configure the syslog facility to capture all commands typed on your system and save them to a log file.

## Step 1: Configure the Syslog Facility

The syslog facility is a powerful logging system that can be used to capture and store system messages, including all commands typed on the system. To configure syslog to capture command history, you need to edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and add the following lines at the end of the file:

```{.bash}
$InputFilePollInterval 1
$InputFileName /var/log/command_history.log
$InputFileStateFile stat-command_history
$InputFileTag command_history:
$InputFileFacility local6
$InputRunFileMonitor
```

These lines instruct rsyslog to monitor the command_history.log file for new entries and tag them with the command_history tag. You can replace command_history.log with any filename you prefer.

## Step 2: Create the Log File and Set Permissions

Next, you need to create the log file and set the appropriate permissions. To create the log file, run the following commands:

```{.bash}
sudo touch /var/log/command_history.log
sudo chown syslog:adm /var/log/command_history.log
sudo chmod 640 /var/log/command_history.log
```

These commands create the log file, set the owner to syslog and the group to adm, and give read and write permissions to the owner and group only.

## Step 3: Restart the Rsyslog Service

Finally, you need to restart the rsyslog service to apply the changes. To do this, run the following command:

```{.bash}
sudo service rsyslog restart
```

Now, whenever a user types a command in any terminal window on the system, the command will be captured by syslog and written to the command_history.log file, along with other details such as the time and date, the user who typed the command, and the terminal window in which the command was typed.



## Conclusion

In this blog post, we showed you how to configure syslog to capture the history of all commands typed on your Linux system, even if using multiple terminals and starting with space. This method can be useful for system administrators who need to keep track of user activity on their systems. However, keep in mind that capturing command history in this way may raise privacy concerns, so it's important to inform your users that their commands are being monitored and ensure that the log file is kept secure and accessible only to authorized personnel.
